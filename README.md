# Hotel Booking EDA Project

## Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a hotel booking dataset. The aim is to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between different variables in the dataset to improve hotel operations and enhance customer experience.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project, `hotel_bookings_2.csv`, contains information about hotel bookings including details such as:
- **Hotel Type**: The type of hotel (e.g., city hotel, resort hotel).
- **Booking Dates**: Check-in and check-out dates, and the number of nights the customer stays.
- **Customer Details**: Features like customer nationality, age, and whether they have children.
- **Cancellation Information**: Data related to whether the booking was canceled and the reasons for cancellation.

## Objective
- Perform EDA to analyze booking trends, cancellation rates, and booking patterns.
- Explore the relationship between various features such as customer nationality, booking lead time, and cancellation status.
- Visualize the findings using charts and graphs to identify patterns.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for performing interactive analysis.

## Key Findings & Insights
- The analysis revealed that the **city hotel** had a higher number of bookings compared to the **resort hotel**.
- There was a significant correlation between **lead time** and **cancellations**. A higher lead time was linked to a higher probability of cancellation.
- Customer nationality analysis showed that **European** customers made the most bookings.
- Cancellations were most common during **peak seasons** like holidays and long weekends.

## Conclusion
This project highlights important trends in hotel bookings that can help optimize booking strategies and improve customer satisfaction. The insights gained can also guide future marketing strategies and pricing policies.
